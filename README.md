## Summary
This repository showcases my natural language processing skills I have acquired this semester. These include working with rules-based, statistical, and ML-based NLP systems, working with N-Grams, text processing and classification, creating corpora, and text parsing. I plan to keep in touch with this field and its developments, and recently I have been thinking on working on an upgraded ML-based version of the chatbot I made for this class.
